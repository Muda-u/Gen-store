# Consuming APIs with React.js

## Description
    I used React.js to demonstrate my knownlege when it comes to consuming apis, and being able to deal with json and manipulate data.
    I used React.js because I wanted to challenge myself to write clean and efficient code with React.js
    This application shows the admin all the products in stock and also allows the user to manipulate those products. (Deleting, adding, modifying)

## Installation
    from the project's directory on the the terminal
    run "npm i" to install all the necessary depencies.
    The web app should be ready to run 
    run "npm start" to start the web app
